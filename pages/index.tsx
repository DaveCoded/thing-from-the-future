                            Using the constraints provided by four cards, invent a Thing From the
                            Future within the time limit. Gain points by coming up with the most
                            interesting, entertaining, or amusing imagined object.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Play as many rounds as you like, and with as many people as you like,
                            though between two and six works best, with four being optimal. And set
                            whatever time limit you like, though weâ€™d suggest between three and five
                            minutes works nicely.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once time is up, have one player read out all the Things without giving
                            away their originator. Then you can all cast a vote for your favourite
                            and award a point to each player for each vote cast for that was cast
                            for their Thing.
