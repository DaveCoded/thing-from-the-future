                        <em>Thing From the Future</em> within the time limit. Gain points by coming
                        up with the most interesting, entertaining, or amusing imagined object.

                        Play as many rounds as you like, and with as many people as you like, though
                        between two and six works best, with four being optimal. And set whatever
                        time limit you like, though weâ€™d suggest between three and five minutes
                        works nicely.

                        Once time is up, have one player read out all the <em>Things</em> without
                        giving away their originator. Then you can all cast a vote for your
                        favourite and award a point to each player for each vote cast for that was
                        cast for their <em>Thing</em>.
