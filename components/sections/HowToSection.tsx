                            Using the constraints provided by four cards, invent a{' '}
                            <em>Thing From the Future</em> within the time limit. Gain points by
                            coming up with the most interesting, entertaining, or amusing imagined
                            object.

                        <P>
                            Play as many rounds as you like, and with as many people as you like,
                            though between two and six works best, with four being optimal. And set
                            whatever time limit you like, though weâ€™d suggest between three and five
                            minutes works nicely.

                            Once time is up, have one player read out all the <em>Things</em>{' '}
                            without giving away their originator. Then you can all cast a vote for
                            your favourite and award a point to each player for each vote cast for
                            that was cast for their <em>Thing</em>.
